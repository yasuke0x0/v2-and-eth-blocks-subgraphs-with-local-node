# Uniswap V2 & ETH Blocks Subgraphs

The goal is to deploy and utilize both subgraphs within a local Graph Node setup: one for indexing events emitted by the Uniswap Factory contract and another for indexing all mined blocks of the
blockchain.
This repo serves as a great example of how to integrate a new blockchain network that isn't yet supported by The Graph.

The factory subgraph dynamically tracks any pair created by the uniswap factory. It tracks of the current state of Uniswap contracts, and contains derived stats for things like historical data and USD
prices.

- aggregated data across pairs and tokens,
- data on individual pairs and tokens,
- data on transactions
- data on liquidity providers
- historical data on Uniswap, pairs or tokens, aggregated by day

The ETH Blocks subgraph tracks all created blocks

## üöÄ Set Up

### üîê Environment Variables (ENV Vars)

The Graph CLI does not natively support environment variable interpolation. You'll need to manually update the required files:

1. **Update Factory Contract Address in graph-cli/v2-subgraph folder:**

- `subgraph.yaml`:
    - Replace `dataSources.source.address` with the factory contract address.
    - Replace `dataSources.source.startBlock` with the factory contract start block (creation block).
- `src/mappings/helpers.ts`: Replace the `FACTORY_ADDRESS` constant with the factory contract address.
- `src/mappings/pricing.ts`: 
  - In WHITELIST constant. Keep the stable coins addresses you want and replace addresses
  - Replace WETH_ADDRESS, DAI_WETH_PAIR, USDC_WETH_PAIR, USDT_WETH_PAIR addresses
2. **Graph Node Configuration:**

- In `graph-node/docker-compose.yml`, update:
    - `services.graph-node.environment.postgres_user`, `postgres_pass`, and `postgres_db`: Set custom database username and password.
    - `services.graph-node.environment.ethereum`: Replace `mainnet:REPLACE_THIS_PLACEHOLDER_WITH_THE_RPC_URL` with your custom RPC URL.
    - `services.postgres.environment.POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Use the same database username and password as above.

### (Optional) Fork EVM for performance
Create a local testnet node for deploying and testing smart contracts using [anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/anvil/).
```bash
anvil --fork-url https://solo-testnet.rpc.caldera.xyz/http --fork-block-number 3571368 --accounts 10 --balance 1000 --chain-id 690023441 --block-time 3
```

### üöí Start a Dockerized Local Node

#### 1. Check Dependencies

Ensure everything is installed by running the script:

```bash
./graph-node/check.sh
```

#### 2. Start Docker Containers

Install Docker images and launch the containers for IPFS, Postgres, and the Graph Node:

```bash
docker-compose -f ./graph-node/docker-compose.yml up
```

Wait for the `ipfs`, `postgres`, and `graph-node` containers to deploy before proceeding to the next steps.

---

### Install graph-cli dependencies

```bash
yarn --cwd ./graph-cli/eth-blocks-subgraph
```

```bash
yarn --cwd ./graph-cli/v2-subgraph
```

### üîß Generate Types Based on Schema

Generate TypeScript types based on your GraphQL schema:

```bash
yarn --cwd ./graph-cli/eth-blocks-subgraph run codegen
```

```bash
yarn --cwd ./graph-cli/v2-subgraph run codegen
```

---

### üé® Create the Subgraph

Create the subgraph locally:

```bash
yarn --cwd ./graph-cli/eth-blocks-subgraph run create-local
```

```bash
yarn --cwd ./graph-cli/v2-subgraph run create-local
```

#### Expected Output from Docker:

```
graph-node-1  | Jan 01 19:54:32.885 INFO Received subgraph_create request, params: SubgraphCreateParams { name: SubgraphName("eth-blocks") }, component: JsonRpcServer
```

```
graph-node-1  | Dec 14 21:10:56.167 INFO Received subgraph_create request, params: SubgraphCreateParams { name: SubgraphName("uniswap-v2") }, component: JsonRpcServer
```

---

### üì¢ Deploy the Subgraphs to the Local Node

Deploy the subgraphs:

```bash
yarn --cwd ./graph-cli/eth-blocks-subgraph run deploy-local
```

```bash
yarn --cwd ./graph-cli/v2-subgraph run deploy-local
```

#### Expected CLI Output:

### ‚ú® You're All Set!

Your local Graph Node is now running and indexing the Uniswap Factory and ETH blocks. You can query your subgraphs at:

```plaintext
http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/uniswap-v2
```

```plaintext
http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/eth-blocks
```

Remember, after deployment, the data will not be available immediately. You must wait for blockchain indexing to complete. The Graph needs to process and insert all contract-emitted events into its
local database before the data becomes accessible.

Here‚Äôs an example of blockchain scan output in a Docker environment:

```
graph-node-1  | Dec 14 22:19:55.434 INFO Scanned blocks [558946, 560945], range_size: 2000, sgd: 1, subgraph_id: QmQKjuhi2ott8Yjn1BRrYFBR5iw8A72dGMZrKHkGdjoTo1, component: BlockStream
```

This output shows the progress of The Graph node syncing with the blockchain, including the number of processed blocks and events. You can monitor this log to track when the data is fully indexed and
ready for use.

## Key Entity Overviews

#### UniswapFactory

Contains data across all of Uniswap V2. This entity tracks important things like total liquidity (in ETH and USD, see below), all time volume, transaction count, number of pairs and more.

#### Token

Contains data on a specific token. This token specific data is aggregated across all pairs, and is updated whenever there is a transaction involving that token.

#### Pair

Contains data on a specific pair.

#### Transaction

Every transaction on Uniswap is stored. Each transaction contains an array of mints, burns, and swaps that occured within it.

#### Mint, Burn, Swap

These contain specifc information about a transaction. Things like which pair triggered the transaction, amounts, sender, recipient, and more. Each is linked to a parent Transaction entity.

#### Block

Every block is stored along with its hash, timestamp, parent hash ...

## Example Queries

### Querying Aggregated Uniswap Data

### Querying pair list

This query returns the 10 first pairs of the factory.

```graphql
{
    pairs(first: 10) {
        id
        token1 {
            id
            name
        }
        token0 {
            id
            name
            symbol
        }
    }
}
```

### Querying Aggregated Uniswap Data

This query fetches aggredated data from all uniswap pairs and tokens, to give a view into how much activity is happening within the whole protocol.

```graphql
{
    uniswapFactories(first: 1) {
        pairCount
        totalVolumeUSD
        totalLiquidityUSD
    }
}
```

### Querying Block Data

This query gets data of the first 10 blocks 
```graphql
{
    blocks(first: 10) {
        id
        timestamp
        number
    }
}
```
